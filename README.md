# my-homepage

I forked this and added my own styling and flavor to the homepage, along with URLs that I find more relevant. The link formatting is in the style of a Python list spanning multiple lines. In addition, it also greets you by name based on the time of day! 

## Install Font

To install the font I am using, install the font file I have included with the download.
